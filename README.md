# Home Automation System with ESP32

## Overview

This project showcases the implementation of a home automation system using the ESP32 microcontroller. The system is designed to control various home electronics such as lights, fans, and windows, offering users remote control and automation capabilities.

## Features

- *Remote Control:* Control home electronics remotely using a web interface or a mobile app.
- *Automation:* Create schedules and rules for automatic control based on time, sensors, or user-defined conditions.
- *Energy Efficiency:* Optimize energy consumption by scheduling devices to turn on/off at specific times.
- *Security:* Enhance home security by simulating occupancy through automated lighting and window control.

## Hardware Requirements

- ESP32 Development Board
- Relays and Transistors for controlling appliances
- Sensors (e.g., motion sensors, light sensors) for automation
- Connecting wires
- Power supply

## Software Requirements

- Arduino IDE or PlatformIO for ESP32 development
- Proficiency in C++ programming
